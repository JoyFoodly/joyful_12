<h2>Welcome to the Joyful 12, <%= @user.first_name %>!</h2>

<p>I’m so happy you’ll be joining me in the Learning Lab. We’ll be cooking our way through
  summer, fall, winter and spring with a total of forty-eight seasonal vegetables and fruits. </p>

<p>Just so you know, we are still building the Joyful 12 Fall and Winter seasons. What that means is that Spring and Summer
  are available now, and when we release our Fall
  and Winter recipes during Fall 2014, you’ll be the first to know! Not only that, but you’ll have unlimited access
  to the Joyful 12 year after year. I can’t wait to get started!</p>

<p>All you have to do is confirm your email in the
  link below, and then you're in the classroom! (easy, right?)</p>

<p>Confirm your account email by clicking on the link:</p>

<p>In the future you can sign in by going to <a href="https://www.joyful12.com">joyful12.com</a>.</p>

<p>I’m sure you’re going to love the Joyful 12 so much, you’ll want to spread some of that veggie love to your family and friends. The Joyful 12 is a great gift for a loved one.
